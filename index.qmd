# Introduction
In recent years, events like the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the COVID-19 pandemic, and shifts in OPEC+ production decisions have significantly impacted oil prices, affecting daily life and industrial costs. This project explores these influences, focusing on major factors ranging from OPEC reserves and global events to local spending trends. By analyzing oil price time series, we identified periods of volatility and researched corresponding events to understand their impact. This approach helps us predict future trends, offering insights for personal and broader economic planning, thereby making this analysis relevant to everyone's daily life. 

This has sparked our interest in the factors affecting oil prices. The factors may range from large-scale issues such as the oil reserves of OPEC members, significant political events, international oil demand, and the oil export volumes of major oil-exporting countries, to smaller-scale aspects like the average household gasoline expenditure in New York and the price trend of a particular industrial product.

By examining the relationship between these factors and oil prices, we can get a clearer understanding of the current international situation and make a general prediction about future oil price trends. This can help us to plan our daily expenses to cope with future changes in the international situation. This project concerns everyone's daily life; Thus, its significance lies in the hope that not only we will benefit from this analysis, but also many others can gain insights from our analysis, thus facing future life with more ease.
