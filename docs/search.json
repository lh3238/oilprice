    "text": "1 Introduction\nRussia-Ukraine conflict, COVID-19 pandemic, OPEC+ changed their production decisions. In the past few years, many important events have happened, which leading to several big changes in oil prices. The dramatic increase in oil prices means not only makes our daily driving more expensive, but also increases the cost of producing the industry goods. This may leads to higher prices for industry products. As a result, the change of oil prices greatly affect our daily life. It is also a key to understanding the current state of the international market and global situation.\nThis has sparked our interest in the factors affecting oil prices. The factors may range from large-scale issues such as the oil reserves of OPEC members, significant political events, international oil demand, and the oil export volumes of major oil-exporting countries, to smaller-scale aspects like the average household gasoline expenditure in New York and the price trend of a particular industrial product.\nBy examining the relationship between these factors and oil prices, we can get a clearer understanding of the current international situation and make a general prediction about future oil price trends. This can help us to plan our daily expenses to cope with future changes in the international situation. This project concerns everyone’s daily life; Thus, its significance lies in the hope that not only we will benefit from this analysis, but also many others can gain insights from our analysis, thus facing future life with more ease."

    "text": "2.1 Technical Description\nThe data for the project can be drawn from the OPEC Annual Statistical Bulletin (ASB), available on the OPEC website. They are collected and compiled by OPEC, an intergovernmental organization of oil-exporting countries. The data in the ASB reflect the combined efforts of OPEC and its member countries in gathering and validating oil and energy-related data.\nThe Summary section includes facts and figures about OPEC members and their crude oil production allocations. The Macro-economics section has data on population, GDP, exports, and imports of OPEC members. The Oil data: upstream section contains information on crude oil reserves, active rigs, wells completed, and oil production. The Oil data: downstream section contains refinery capacities, throughput, petroleum products output, and oil demand. The Oil trade section has data on crude oil and petroleum products exports and imports. The Oil transportation section contains information on average spot freight rates, dirty tanker spot freight rates, and clean tanker spot freight rates. The Oil prices section includes data on OPEC Reference Basket prices, various spot crude oil prices, average forward month prices, and petroleum product spot prices in major markets. The Taxes on oil section contains information on composite barrel components and tax ratios in OECD countries, along with household energy prices in Europe. The Natural gas data section provides details on natural gas reserves, production, exports, imports, and demand by country.\nWhile the specific update frequency is not stated, the ASB is typically published annually, providing yearly data. The data dimensions vary depending on the table, including country-specific details, global aggregates, and category-specific breakdowns.\nOne potential issue with the data could be the time lag in reporting and updating, given its annual publication. Also, the accuracy of the data depends on the reliability of the reporting by member countries.\nThe data are available in various tables, which can be downloaded as a zip archive from the OPEC ASB website. They can be imported by downloading the relevant tables in the provided format (Excel) and then processing them using R."

    "text": "2.2 Research plan\nFor this analysis, we will utilize the data provided by the OPEC Annual Statistical Bulletin (ASB), a valuable resource that sheds light on aspects such as oil production, consumption, export-import dynamics, and pricing. Our approach includes a mix of time series analysis to track oil price trends, especially during significant global events, and comparative analysis using bar and column charts to contrast oil reserves, production, and exports among different countries or regions, particularly focusing on OPEC members.\nWe plan to employ correlation analysis through scatter plots to explore relationships between variables like OPEC+ production decisions and oil prices. We’ll also use box graphs to look at how oil prices change over time. Stacked area charts will help us visualize the cumulative changes in oil prices due to various factors over time, while heat maps will aid in analyzing complex, multi-dimensional data.\nOur methodology involves comprehensive data processing using statistical software like R and detailed statistical analysis including correlation, regression, and time-series analysis. We anticipate challenges such as data lag due to the annual nature of the ASB report and potential accuracy issues with data reported by member countries.\nThe expected outcomes of this research include a multifaceted understanding of how global events, policy decisions, and market trends impact oil prices. We aim to provide insights into the relative influence of macro and micro-level factors on oil price fluctuations and develop predictive models for future oil price trends based on historical and current data."

A clear pattern is visible where most countries and regions have continuous data with no missing values. In contrast, countries like Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan, show a long horizontal band of missing data in the years 1960-1991, which can be explained by their historical context. These countries were part of the Soviet Union until its dissolution in 1991. During this time, natural gas reserves and other statistical data were reported at the union level rather than for individual republics. Therefore, specific data for these countries might not have been available or recorded in the dataset. After gaining independence post-1991, these countries started reporting their data separately, which is why the missing data is predominantly seen in the years prior to their independence."

There is a general upward trend with some fluctuations. The top right graph adjusts the nominal price for exchange rate fluctuations. The overall trend is similar to the nominal price trend, with slight differences in the peaks and troughs, indicating the impact of exchange rates on oil prices. When adjusted for inflation, the price trends show less dramatic growth over time, suggesting that some of the increases in nominal price can be attributed to inflation. The early 1980s peak is much more pronounced in this graph compared to the nominal price, indicating that the real value of oil was particularly high during that period. The bottom right graph combines both adjustments for inflation and exchange rates, providing a more comprehensive view of the real oil price trends. The trend is smoother than the nominal graph but shows significant peaks and troughs that correspond with significant historical events affecting the oil market. The price trends generally follow the same patterns across all facets, which suggests that the adjustments for exchange rates and inflation do not dramatically alter the overall shape of the trends, while the trends in oil prices show significant volatility, with notable increases during periods of geopolitical tension or economic events that disrupted oil supply or increased demand, such as 1973-1974 Oil Crisis, 1979-1980 Iranian Revolution and Iran-Iraq War, 1986 Oil Price Collapse, 1990-1991 Gulf War, Late 1990s Asian Financial Crisis, 2000s Energy Crisis, 2008 Financial Crisis, and 2020 COVID-19 Pandemic."

Gasoline and Gasoil exhitbit similar prices over the years, while Fuel oil tends to have the lowest price points. This pattern can be explained by the following reasoning: while Gasoline and Gasoil are predominantly used for transportation, a sector that experiences relatively consistent and growing demand, Fuel oil’s usage is more niche and is being increasingly replaced by other fuels due to environmental concerns, which suppresses its price. Also, Gasoline and Gasoil require more complex refining, which is more expensive. On the other hand, Fuel oil, being a heavier product, requires less refining. There are notable peaks and troughs which might correspond to significant global events, changes in market dynamics, or policy decisions that impacted oil prices. Price spikes may align with events that disrupt supply, such as geopolitical conflicts in oil-producing regions (e.g., the Gulf War, sanctions on oil-producing countries), natural disasters affecting production (e.g., hurricanes hitting the Gulf Coast), or decisions by oil-producing countries to cut production. Economic booms lead to higher demand for energy, driving up prices, while recessions can cause a drop in demand and prices. The global financial crisis of 2008, for example, saw a sharp decrease in commodity prices, including oil. Implementation of environmental policies or changes in subsidies for fossil fuels can impact prices. For instance, the adoption of cleaner energy technologies and stricter emission regulations can reduce demand for certain oil products, affecting their prices."

Here we use side-by-side box plots to explore the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on oil prices. The oil prices appear to be higher and less volatile during the pre-pandemic period, with a narrower interquartile range, indicating less variability in prices. The median price is within the upper half of the IQR, suggesting a slight skew towards higher prices within this period. There are no visible outliers, indicating that oil prices did not experience extreme deviations from the general price levels during this period. During the pandemic period, the median oil price is notably lower than the pre-pandemic period, which reflects the significant impact of the pandemic on reducing oil prices. The IQR is wider in this period, suggesting increased volatility in oil prices during the pandemic. The presence of the outlier below the lower whisker indicates that there were instances of extremely low prices. In the post-pandemic period, the median oil price has increased from the pandemic period, suggesting a recovery in prices. The IQR is also wide, which indicates that the volatility continues, albeit with generally higher prices than during the pandemic. There are no outliers visible in the post-pandemic period, suggesting a stabilization of prices without extreme peaks or troughs. Overall, the graph shows a clear drop in median prices and an increase in volatility during the pandemic, followed by a recovery in the post-pandemic period."

The pre-policy oil prices have a wide distribution, indicating variability in oil prices before the production cut agreement. There’s a noticeable peak around the 40 to 50 USD price range, suggesting that a significant number of oil price observations fell into this bracket. The post-policy oil prices exhibit a shift to the right and appear to be bimodal. This might indicate that the policy led to increased prices. Both distributions have a significant range, but the pre-policy distribution shows that the prices are more spread out across different values and have greater volatility. There is a big area of overlap between the two distributions in the 40 to 60 USD range. This indicates that while the policy shifted prices upwards, some of the pre-policy price range remained common post-policy."

This is expected, as higher oil prices would naturally boost the revenue from exports of petroleum, assuming export quantities remain relatively stable. The correlation between oil prices and current account balances is also robust at 0.872, indicating that the current account balances of OPEC members are strongly associated with oil prices. Higher oil prices typically translate into greater export revenues, contributing positively to the current account. The real GDP growth rate shows a weak correlation with oil prices (0.214). The low value suggests that the economic growth rates of OPEC members, as measured by real GDP growth, may not have a strong direct linear relationship with oil prices. In essence, the scatter plot matrix highlights that oil prices have a substantial and statistically significant correlation with petroleum exports and current account balances, which are critical economic parameters for oil-exporting countries. The real GDP growth rate’s connection to oil prices appears to be much less pronounced."

Similarly, the lines between Oil Price and Oil Demand show varying trends, indicating that the price of oil doesn’t always move in tandem with demand. The Biofuel Production and Natural Gas Production axes show a wider spread of the lines, indicating varying levels of production across the data points. The relationship between these variables and oil prices is less clear, but there appears to be less direct correlation, as the lines do not show a consistent pattern when crossing from Oil Price to Biofuel Production and Natural Gas Production. There is a noticeable crisscrossing of lines across all variables, which highlights the complexity and potential interactions between these factors. It suggests that the impact on oil prices is multi-faceted and not dependent on a single factor. In conclusion, this parallel coordinates plot illustrates the complexity of the factors that impact oil prices. It suggests that oil prices are influenced by a combination of production, demand, and possibly the introduction of alternative energy sources, with no single factor consistently dominating the price movement. The varied crossing points of the lines suggest that these relationships are not linear and are likely influenced by a multitude of other economic, geopolitical, and market-specific factors not captured in this plot alone."

This representation suggests that tax cuts might be associated with a range of price levels but are less often associated with the lowest oil price category. For tax increases, the plot shows a more significant presence in the High oil price category across Low Growth and Moderate Growth categories. This could imply that tax increases aren’t necessarily more likely when oil prices and GDP growth are higher, possibly as a fiscal response to additional revenue from higher oil prices. In the Low Growth GDP category, there’s a substantial area in both the Medium and Low oil price categories, indicating that low GDP growth coincides with low oil prices in this dataset. For Moderate Growth, the distribution across oil price categories is relatively even, with High oil prices being slightly more prevalent. Interestingly, in the High Growth GDP category, the plot suggests a balanced distribution across the Medium and High oil price categories, with a smaller presence in the Low category. This suggests that higher economic growth may correlate with higher oil prices."

    "text": "We used a stacked bar chart to compare the relationship between regional and organizational oil export volumes and the total world oil export volume. Compared to using simple bar or line charts, this approach not only informs us about the historical oil export volumes of regions and organizations but also shows the proportion of these exports in the world’s total oil exports. Understanding both aspects is crucial for analyzing oil prices, as the amount of oil exported determines the influence of a region or organization on global oil prices. However, knowing the export volume alone is insufficient. For instance, while OPEC’s oil exports in 2022 increased compared to 1980, its share in the global oil export market has declined. By comparing the export volumes of other regions, we found that OECD’s oil exports have been increasing annually. This can be attributed to two main reasons. First, since 2010, the maturation of shale oil extraction technology in the United States has turned it into a major oil exporter , thereby encroaching on OPEC’s market share. Second, for political and security reasons, the OECD, led by the United States, intentionally reduced its reliance on oil imports from OPEC countries and gradually shifted to purchasing oil from other regions. Interactive graphics created with D3 make it easier and clearer for us to identify these trends, thereby assisting us in conducting a more objective and accurate analysis of other aspects."
